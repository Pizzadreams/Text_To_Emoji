# Text to Emoji Translator

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive web application that translates human-readable text into emoji-rich messages. Users can enter natural language text, and the app intelligently converts words or phrases into corresponding emojis to make the communication fun and visually engaging.

## Key Features
- **Text Input:** Users enter any sentence or phrase into a simple web interface.
- **Emoji Conversion:** The app identifies meaningful words or phrases and replaces them with emojis.
- **Custom Emoji Mapping:** Supports customizable word-to-emoji dictionaries for precise control over translations.
- **API Integration:** Leverages external emoji APIs to enhance emoji suggestions and variety.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Built with Streamlit for rapid prototyping and deployment as a lightweight web app.

## How It Works
1. User types text into the input box.
2. The app processes text using natural language techniques (regex, NLP) to identify words for emoji substitution.
3. Selected words are replaced by emoji characters using Python emoji libraries and APIs.
4. Resulting emoji-enriched text is displayed dynamically to the user.

## Usage
- Run the Streamlit app locally or via deployed web hosting.
- Enter any text in the input field.
- View and share the emoji translation output generated instantly.

## Future Goals
- Cleaner UI
